===================

MultiHuggingGradio was meticulously crafted to empower the development of web applications using the powerful synergy of Hugging Face and Gradio libraries. This dynamic package is designed to excel in multi-modality tasks, seamlessly handling challenges such as text generation and image classification.

To set up an environment capable of running this package smoothly, please follow the steps provided below. Our repository is intricately linked with GitHub Actions, which automates critical processes such as building, testing, and deployment. In the testing phase, we rely on the robust capabilities of pytest and pytest-cov to rigorously evaluate our tests and analyze their coverage, ensuring the utmost reliability and performance.

## üìê How to Install

CUDA_VERSION is machine dependent, in this installation version v11.6 (cu116) is installed, change depending on machine cuda version 
```shell
conda activate <your_env_name>

pip install -e multihugginggradio -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116/torch_stable.html
```

## üìà Tests

Test files should start with prefix "test_" to become discoverable by pytest. --cov flag will also create a coverage information for the tests
Run tests with:
```shell
pytest --cov=multihugginggradio/multihugginggradio
```
