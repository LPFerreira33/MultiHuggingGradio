## üìê How to Install

CUDA_VERSION is machine dependent, in this installation version v11.6 (cu116) is installed, change depending on machine cuda version.
Note: environment needs to be version 3.8.16.
```shell
conda activate <your_env_name>

pip install -e multihugginggradio -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116/torch_stable.html
```

## üìà Tests

Test files should start with prefix "test_" to become discoverable by pytest. --cov-report=html flag will create a coverage information in html form.
